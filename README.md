# Multifunction_Button-master

The code used for this interface was custom written from scratch. Essentially it monitors the pressed state of the switch and calculates the time variance to give two distinct activation gestures - short press, and long press. All the details on how it works are commented within the source files.

Download the sketch and all the accompanying source files to go with it. Open inside of the Arduino software or using the specific Visual Studio project files. Compile and flash the code to the microcontroller.
